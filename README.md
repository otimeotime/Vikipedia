### How to install (Intellij and Apache Netbean are recommended)
1. Pull the repo into the local machine
2. Add dependency files to the project from the "Dependency" folder in the repo
3. Run the Application.java file
Note: This project does not have a database, so in order to push everything to github, we have to remove the video files from the repository, thus the video functionality will not able to work.
